{% capture subheader %}
Mathesar is a straightforward open source and self-hostable tool.
The web-based interface helps you and your team work with data more independently. And comfortably.

You can use Mathesar to build data models, enter data, use that data and even understand the impact of your data.

### Our mission

We’re not trying to create new abstractions. Or make a complex tool that people struggle to get their heads around. We’re aiming to stay true to database ideals.

We want to make existing Postgres functionality more accessible – in a user-friendly way.

Mathesar is a tool that our entire team wants to use. We're our own users.

### Who is building Mathesar?

Mathesar is a project of the Center for Complex Interventions, a nonprofit that helps communities translate science into action.

We’re currently funded through the generous support of Reid Hoffman and the Center for Radical Transformation at the Chiba Institute of Technology.

### Here’s the team behind Mathesar

+ Our favorite database hobby projects!

### Our plans for sustainability

We’re currently working towards our first Alpha release. After the launch, we’ll iterate quickly – in collaboration with our early adopters – until we have Version 1.0 ready for wider adoption.

This initial development has been funded philanthropically. At the same time, we’re working towards self-sustainability.

We haven’t yet decided on a business model, but one thing we know for certain: Mathesar will always be open-source and self-hostable.
