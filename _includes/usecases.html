PROTOTYPE NEW IDEAS
Quickly fill in any gaps using Mathesar’s interface

Prototype experiences quickly. Swap Mathesar in for the parts you haven’t built yet so you can speed up your workflow.

ADMIN INTERFACE TO EXISTING DATABASES
Gain different views of your data

Open up access to your existing Postgres database – giving non-technical collaborators the freedom to enter data or explore new insights.

They can query the data across multiple tables.

PUBLISH DATA SETS
Let other people explore your data freely

Exporting your data into a CSV format often causes your data to lose some integrity.
Publishing your data using Mathesar’s interface allows you to retain your data’s schema and format.

Members of the public can use the interface to explore your data and find insights.

DATA CONSOLIDATION
Bring data from different sources into a single format

Import data from multiple sources and consolidate them into a single format.
Set up constraints at the column level to ensure data validation and integrity for new data.

You could also use Mathesar for:

- Project Management
- Tracking Expenses
- Event Planning
- CRM Usage
