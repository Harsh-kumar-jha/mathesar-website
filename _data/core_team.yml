    "My husband and I use a database-backed application to **track movies**. Movies we own, movies we want to watch, movies we’ve watched.
    
    I had to write a bunch of code for it, but it would have been much faster to build it using Mathesar – if it had existed!"

    "As someone who really enjoys cooking at home, I'm thinking Mathesar would be a great for storing all my recipes in one place. Being able to search and filter my recipes based on ingredients and cooking time would be really cool. I'm excited to give it a try!"

    "I intend to use a database to maintain a **personal diary**, but with data tracking!

    I'll be logging my daily life: my anime watching habits, exercise routine, work progress, social interactions etc.,
    I can analyze this data to gain valuable insights into my own behavior and lifestyle.
    
    Mathesar is going to make all of this a breeze!"

    "I'm using a database (and planning to use Mathesar) to store and analyze info I collect about various countries. e.g. cost of living, tax rates, population statistics, economic statistics, etc.
    
    I'm tentatively calling it the **Country Comparator**."

    "I use calculators **for MMORPG games**, to find the most efficient item to use for doing something in the game. 
    
    Since the game has a real-time market, a relational database is really useful for reflecting the price changes across a lot of calculators."

    "Mathesar would be great for **scraping and reporting**. For example, I scraped a poorly-done government website for making appointments with doctors. That allowed me to query reservation slots, watch for cancellations, and book a consultation much earlier than I otherwise could have."
