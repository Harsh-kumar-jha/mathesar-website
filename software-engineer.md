Use Mathesar’s open source and web-based interface to give your team direct access to Postgres. No technical skills required.

Now you can spend less time creating custom reports and manually updating data.

### Speed up your data workflows – using Mathesar’s open source interface

You can ensure data integrity. Perform quick
schema changes. And let teammates create reports – without depending on you.

Mathesar doesn’t have its own set of abstractions so it won’t make unexpected changes to your database. You can allow your collaborators to quickly enter data and create reports – without depending on you.

#### BUILT ON POSTGRES

### Use Postgres directly

Mathesar uses and manipulates Postgres schemas, primary keys, foreign keys, constraints and data types.

So any configuration you do in the UI will reflect directly in your Postgres databases.
Nothing will prevent you from working with the same data in other tools outside of Mathesar.

All the same data integrity safeguards you set up via the Mathesar UI will still apply.

#### SELF-HOSTED

### Your data is yours

Proprietary companies can keep you locked in their ecosystem. This can make it difficult to modify your disparate data sources.

If you decide to move away, you could lose data.

Mathesar is self-hosted – giving you full control over your system and your data. You can integrate with other Postgres-friendly tools.

#### NORMALIZED DATA

### Your collaborators can easily work with normalized data

Non-technical people often struggle to work with normalized data. Even database-spreadsheet hybrid applications complicate the normalization process.

Mathesar creates and reflects relationships at the database level.  There are no “relationship column types” and there are no abstractions.

Mathesar uses actual foreign key constraints and provides a UI to understand links easily – no technical skills required.

#### EASY UX

### Reduce dependencies on you – empower collaborators to use your database

Your colleagues can use Mathesar’s interface to answer their ad-hoc questions quickly.

This can reduce the need for you to create custom reports and update data manually.

#### OPEN SOURCE

### Developed in collaboration with our community

Mathesar is free, licensed under GPLv3. There are no paid plans.

Although we’re new, we already have dozens of contributors. If you’re interested, you can also contribute.

We work in public – you can check out what our team is doing on Matrix. And via our mailing lists.

#### SCHEMA MIGRATIONS

### Perform schema changes – in minutes

Manually changing your schema can require hours of rote work or custom code.
This can lead to disruptions – like downtime, stale data and difficulties in meeting your SLA.

Mathesar makes schema and data migrations a one-click solution.
There are no disruptions – which can help ease your data integration workflow.

#### DATA EXPLORER

### Build views across multiple tables

Database joins can be confusing for non-technical users to fully understand.

With Mathesar’s Data Explorer, your collaborators don’t need to understand joins. They can see and use relationships between data – with the joins happening behind the scenes.

Anyone can build a query through the UI that displays data from across multiple tables.

This can remove the dependency layer on you and allow for more exploration into your database.

### You and your collaborators can quickly enter data. View it. Slice it

Move data around. Transform and filter it.
While still retaining structure and consistency.

### Special Use Cases

PROTOTYPE NEW IDEAS
Quickly fill in any gaps using Mathesar’s interface

Prototype experiences quickly. Swap Mathesar in for the parts you haven’t built yet so you can speed up your workflow.

ADMIN INTERFACE TO EXISTING DATABASES
Gain different views of your data

Open up access to your existing Postgres database – giving non-technical collaborators the freedom to enter data or explore new insights.

They can query the data across multiple tables.

PUBLISH DATA SETS
Let other people explore your data freely

Exporting your data into a CSV format often causes your data to lose some integrity.
Publishing your data using Mathesar’s interface allows you to retain your data’s schema and format.

Members of the public can use the interface to explore your data and find insights.

DATA CONSOLIDATION
Bring data from different sources into a single format

Import data from multiple sources and consolidate them into a single format.
Set up constraints at the column level to ensure data validation and integrity for new data.

You could also use Mathesar for:

Project Management
Tracking Expenses
Event
Planning
CRM
Usage

### Use Mathesar as a flexible tool throughout your project lifecycle.

Migrate your data any time you want to. Or simply go back and forth from the interface.

- Use Mathesar to set up a backend for your custom application.
- Mathesar can work as frontend to existing databases, without altering your data.
